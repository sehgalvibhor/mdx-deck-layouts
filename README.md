#### VerticalFlex.js
Creates a flex-box layout of direct components stacked vertically (columns).


#### HorizontalFlex.js
Creates a flex-box layout of direct components stacked horizontally, better than conventional LeftRight layout if the number of elements are greater than 2.


#### Provider.js
Updated Provider file with an added Footer which displays the slide count as 'Slide 1 of N' apart from the dots at the bottom.
